| :--- | :--- |
| **Space** | Jump |
| **S** | Shoot |
| **A / D** | Move Left / Right |
| **Q** | Quit |

## Learning Outcomes
* Mastered **2D Arrays** for game state management.
* Implemented **File I/O** for high-score persistence.
* Developed real-time **Collision Detection** and game loop logic.
